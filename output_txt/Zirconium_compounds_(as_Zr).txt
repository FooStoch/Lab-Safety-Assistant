Fairchild, II, Associate Director for Cincinnati Operations, which called for “no detectable exposure levels for proven carcinogenic substances” (Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 271:200-207, 1976). This was in response to a generic OSHA rulemaking on carcinogens. Because of advances in science and in approaches to risk assessment and risk management, NIOSH has adopted a more inclusive policy. NIOSH recommended exposure limits (RELs) will be based on risk evaluations using human or animal health effects data, and on an assessment of what levels can be feasibly achieved by engineering controls and measured by analytical techniques. To the extent feasible, NIOSH will project not only a no effect exposure, but also exposure levels at which there may be residual risks. This policy applies to all workplace hazards, including carcinogens, and is responsive to Section 20(a)(3) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, which charges NIOSH to “. . .describe exposure levels that are safe for various periods of employment, including but not limited to the exposure levels at which no employee will suffer impaired health or functional capacities or diminished life expectancy as a result of his work experience.” The effect of this new policy will be the development, whenever possible, of quantitative RELs that are based on human and/or animal data, as well as on the consideration of technological feasibility for controlling workplace exposures to the REL. Under the old policy, RELs for most carcinogens were non-quantitative values labeled “lowest feasible concentration (LFC).” [Note: There are a few exceptions to LFC RELs for carcinogens (e.g., RELs for asbestos, formaldehyde, benzene, and ethylene oxide are quantitative values based primarily on analytical limits of detection or technological feasibility). Also, in 1989, NIOSH adopted several quantitative RELs for carcinogens from OSHA's permissible exposure limit (PEL) update.] Under the new policy, NIOSH will also recommend the complete range of respirators (as determined by the NIOSH Respirator Decision Logic) for carcinogens with quantitative RELs. In this way, respirators will be consistently recommended regardless of whether a substance is a carcinogen or a non-carcinogen. 342 A P P E N D I X A Appendix A (Continued) NIOSH POTENTIAL OCCUPATIONAL CARCINOGENS Old Policy In the past, NIOSH identified numerous substances that should be treated as potential occupational carcinogens even though OSHA might not have identified them as such. In determining their carcinogenicity, NIOSH used the OSHA classification outlined in 29 CFR 1990.103, which states in part: Potential occupational carcinogen means any substance, or combination or mixture of substances, which causes an increased incidence of benign and/or malignant neoplasms, or a substantial decrease in the latency period between exposure and onset of neoplasms in humans or in one or more experimental mammalian species as the result of any oral, respiratory or dermal exposure, or any other exposure which results in the induction of tumors at a site other than the site of administration. This definition also includes any substance which is metabolized into one or more potential occupational carcinogens by mammals. When thresholds for carcinogens that would protect 100% of the population had not been identified, NIOSH usually recommended that occupational exposures to carcinogens be limited to the lowest feasible concentration. To ensure maximum protection from carcinogens through the use of respiratory protection, NIOSH also recommended that only the most reliable and protective respirators be used. These respirators include (1) a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) that has a full facepiece and is operated in a positive pressure mode, or (2) a supplied air respirator that has a full facepiece and is operated in a pressure demand or other positive pressure mode in combination with an auxiliary SCBA operated in a pressure demand or other positive pressure mode. Recommendations to be Revised The RELs and respirator recommendations for carcinogens listed in this edition of the Pocket Guide still reflect the old policy. Changes in the RELs and respirator recommendations that reflect the new policy will be included in future editions. 343 A P P E N D I X B Appendix B THIRTEEN OSHA-REGULATED CARCINOGENS Without establishing PELs, OSHA promulgated standards in 1974 to regulate the industrial use of the following 13 chemicals identified as potential occupational carcinogens: • 2-Acetylaminofluorene • 4-Aminodiphenyl • Benzidine • bis-Chloromethyl ether • 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine • 4-Dimethylaminoazobenzene • Ethyleneimine • Methyl chloromethyl ether • α-Naphthylamine • β-Naphthylamine • 4-Nitrobiphenyl • N-Nitrosodimethylamine • β-Propiolactone Exposures of workers to these 13 chemicals are to be controlled through the required use of engineering controls, work practices, and personal protective equipment, including respirators. OSHA respirator requirements for these chemicals are provided in Appendix E (page 351). See 29 CFR 1910.1003 - 1910.1016 for more specific details of these requirements. 344 A P P E N D I X C Appendix C SUPPLEMENTARY EXPOSURE LIMITS Aldehydes (Low-Molecular-Weight) Exposure to acetaldehyde has produced nasal tumors in rats and laryngeal tumors in hamsters, and exposure to malonaldehyde has produced thyroid gland and pancreatic islet cell tumors in rats. NIOSH therefore recommends that acetaldehyde and malonaldehyde be considered potential occupational carcinogens in conformance with the OSHA carcinogen policy. Testing has not been completed to determine the carcinogenicity of the following nine related low-molecular-weight aldehydes: ● Acrolein (CAS# 107-02-8) ● Paraformaldehyde (CAS# 30525-89-4) ● Butyraldehyde (CAS# 123-72-8) ● Propiolaldehyde (CAS# 624-67-9) ● Crotonaldehyde (CAS# 4170-30-3) ● Propionaldehyde (CAS# 123-38-6) ● Glutaraldehyde (CAS# 111-30-8) ● n-Valeraldehyde (CAS# 110-62-3) ● Glyoxal (CAS# 107-22-2) However, the limited studies to date indicate that these substances have chemical reactivity and mutagenicity similar to acetaldehyde and malonaldehyde. Therefore, NIOSH recommends that careful consideration should be given to reducing exposures to these nine related aldehydes. Further information can be found in NIOSH Current Intelligence Bulletin 55: Carcinogenicity of Acetaldehyde and Malonaldehyde, and Mutagenicity of Related Low-Molecular-Weight Aldehydes [DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 91-112]. This document is available on the NIOSH Web site (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/91112_55.html). Asbestos NIOSH considers asbestos to be a potential occupational carcinogen and recommends that exposures be reduced to the lowest feasible concentration. For asbestos fibers >5 micrometers in length, NIOSH recommends a REL of 100,000 fibers per cubic meter of air (100,000 fibers/m3 ), which is equal to 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air (0.1 fiber/cm3 ), as determined by a 400-liter air sample collected over 100 minutes in accordance with NIOSH Analytical Method #7400. Airborne asbestos fibers are defined as those particles having (1) an aspect ratio of 3 to 1 or greater and (2) the mineralogic characteristics (that is, the crystal structure and elemental composition) of the asbestos minerals and their nonasbestiform analogs. The asbestos minerals are defined as chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite (cummingtonite-grunerite), anthophyllite, tremolite, and actinolite. In addition, airborne cleavage fragments from the nonasbestiform habits of the serpentine minerals antigorite and lizardite, and the amphibole minerals contained in the series cummingtonite-grunerite, tremolite-ferroactinolite, and glaucophane-riebeckite should also be counted as fibers provided they meet the criteria for a fiber when viewed microscopically. As found in 29 CFR 1910.1001, the OSHA PEL for asbestos fibers (i.e., actinolite asbestos, amosite, anthophyllite asbestos, chrysotile, crocidolite, and tremolite asbestos) is an 8-hour TWA airborne concentration of 0.1 fiber (longer than 5 micrometers and having a length to diameter ratio of at least 3 to 1) per cubic centimeter of air (0.1 fiber/cm3 ), as determined by the membrane filter method at approximately 400X magnification with phase contrast illumination. No worker should be exposed in excess of 1 fiber/cm3 (excursion limit) as averaged over a sampling period of 30 minutes. 345 A P P E N D I X C Appendix C (Continued) SUPPLEMENTARY EXPOSURE LIMITS Asphalt Fumes The recommendations provided below are from Health Effects of Occupational Exposure to Asphalt [DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 2001-110] (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/01-110pd.html). Occupational exposure to asphalt fumes shall be controlled so that employees are not exposed to the airborne particulates at a concentration greater than 5 mg/m3 , determined during any 15-minute period. Data regarding the potential carcinogenicity of paving asphalt fumes in humans are limited, and no animal studies have examined the carcinogenic potential of either field- or laboratory generated samples of paving asphalt fume condensates. NIOSH concludes that the collective data currently available from studies on paving asphalt provide insufficient evidence for an association between lung cancer and exposure to asphalt during paving. The results from epidemiologic studies indicate that roofers are at an increased risk of lung cancer, but it is uncertain whether this increase can be attributed to asphalt and/or to other exposures such as coal tar or asbestos. Data from experimental studies in animals and cultured mammalian cells indicate that laboratory-generated roofing asphalt fume condensates are genotoxic and cause skin tumors in mice when applied dermally. Furthermore, a known carcinogen (Benzo(a)pyrene) was detected in field-generated roofing fumes. The collective health and exposure data provide sufficient evidence for NIOSH to conclude that roofing asphalt fumes are a potential occupational carcinogen. The available data indicate that although not all asphalt-based paint formulations may exert genotoxicity, some are genotoxic and carcinogenic in animals. No published data examine the carcinogenic potential of asphalt-based paints in humans, but NIOSH concludes that asphalt based paints are potential occupational carcinogens. Benzidine-, o-Tolidine-, and o-Dianisidine-based Dyes In December 1980, OSHA and NIOSH jointly published the Health Hazard Alert: Benzidine-, o-Tolidine-, and o-Dianisidine-based Dyes [DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 81-106] (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/81-106.html). In this Alert, OSHA and NIOSH concluded that benzidine and benzidine-based dyes were potential occupational carcinogens and recommended that worker exposure be reduced to the lowest feasible level. OSHA and NIOSH further concluded that o-tolidine and o-dianisidine (and dyes based on them) may present a cancer risk to workers and should be handled with caution and exposure minimized. Carbon Black NIOSH considers “Carbon Black” to be the material consisting of more than 80% elemental carbon, in the form of near-spherical colloidal particles and coalesced particle aggregates of colloidal size, that is obtained by the partial combustion or thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons. The NIOSH REL (10-hour TWA) for carbon black is 3.5 mg/m3 . Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), particulate polycyclic organic material (PPOM), and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PNAs) are terms frequently used to describe various petroleum-based substances that NIOSH considers to be potential occupational carcinogens. Since some of these aromatic hydrocarbons may be formed during the manufacture of carbon black (and become adsorbed on the carbon black), the NIOSH REL (10-hour TWA) for carbon black in the presence 346 A 347 P P E N D I X C Appendix C (Continued) SUPPLEMENTARY EXPOSURE LIMITS of PAHs is 0.1 mg PAHs/m3 (measured as the cyclohexane-extractable fraction). The OSHA PEL (8-hour TWA) for carbon black is 3.5 mg/m3 . Chloroethanes NIOSH considers the following four chemicals to be potential occupational carcinogens: ● Ethylene dichloride ● 1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane ● Hexachloroethane ● 1,1,2-Trichloroethane Additionally, NIOSH recommends that the following five other chloroethane compounds be treated in the workplace with caution because of their structural similarity to the four chloroethanes shown to be carcinogenic in animals: ● 1,1-Dichloroethane ● Methyl chloroform ● 1,1,1,2-Tetrachloroethane ● Ethyl chloride ● Pentachloroethane Chromic Acid and Chromates (as CrO3), Chromium(II) and Chromium(III) Compounds (as Cr), and Chromium Metal (as Cr) The NIOSH REL (10-hour TWA) is 0.001 mg Cr(VI)/m3 for all hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] compounds. NIOSH considers all Cr(VI) compounds (including chromic acid, tert-butyl chromate, zinc chromate, and chromyl chloride) to be potential occupational carcinogens. The NIOSH REL (8-hour TWA) is 0.5 mg Cr/m3 for chromium metal and chromium(II) and chromium(III) compounds. The OSHA PEL is 0.005 mg CrO3/m3 (8-hour TWA) for chromic acid and chromates (including tert-butyl chromate with a “skin” designation and zinc chromate); 0.5 mg Cr/m3 (8- hour TWA) for chromium(II) and chromium(III) compounds; and 1 mg Cr/m3 (8-hour TWA) for chromium metal and insoluble salts. Coal Dust and Coal Mine Dust The NIOSH REL (10-hour TWA) for respirable coal mine dust is 1 mg/m3 , measured using a coal mine personal sampler unit (CPSU) as defined in 30 CFR 74.2. The REL is equivalent to 0.9 mg/m3 measured according to the ISO/CEN/ACGIH (International Standards Organization/ Comité Européen de Normalisation/American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists) definition of respirable dust. The REL applies to respirable coal mine dust and respirable coal dust in occupations other than mining. NIOSH recommends a separate REL for crystalline silica. See NIOSH publication 95-106 (Criteria for a Recommended Standard - Occupational Exposure to Respirable Coal Mine Dust) for more detailed information. Coal Tar Pitch Volatiles NIOSH considers coal tar products (i.e., coal tar, coal tar pitch, or creosote) to be potential occupational carcinogens; the NIOSH REL (10-hour TWA) for coal tar products is 0.1 mg/m3 (cyclohexane-extractable fraction). The OSHA PEL (8-hour TWA) for coal tar pitch volatiles is 0.2 mg/m3 (benzene-soluble fraction). OSHA defines “coal tar pitch volatiles” in 29 CFR 1910.1002 as the fused polycyclic hydrocarbons that volatilize from the distillation residues of coal, petroleum (excluding asphalt), A P P E N D I X C Appendix C (Continued) SUPPLEMENTARY EXPOSURE LIMITS wood, and other organic matter and includes substances such as anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), phenanthrene, acridine, chrysene, pyrene, etc. Coke Oven Emissions The production of coke by the carbonization of bituminous coal leads to the release of chemically-complex emissions from coke ovens that include both gases and particulate matter of varying chemical composition. The emissions include coal tar pitch volatiles (e.g., particulate polycyclic organic matter [PPOM], polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs], and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons [PNAs]), aromatic compounds (e.g., benzene and β-naphthylamine), trace metals (e.g., arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, and nickel), and gases (e.g., nitric oxides and sulfur dioxide). Cotton Dust (raw) NIOSH recommends reducing exposures to cotton dust to the lowest feasible concentration to reduce the prevalence and severity of byssinosis; the REL is <0.200 mg/m3 (as lint free cotton dust). As found in OSHA Table Z-1 (29 CFR 1910.1000), the PEL for cotton dust (raw) is 1 mg/m3 for the cotton waste processing operations of waste recycling (sorting, blending, cleaning, and willowing) and garnetting. PELs for other sectors (as found in 29 CFR 1910.1043) are 0.200 mg/m3 for yarn manufacturing and cotton washing operations, 0.500 mg/m3 for textile mill waste house operations or for dust from “lower grade washed cotton” used during yarn manufacturing, and 0.750 mg/m3 for textile slashing and weaving operations. The OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.1043 does not apply to cotton harvesting, ginning, or the handling and processing of woven or knitted materials and washed cotton. All PELs for cotton dust are mean concentrations of lint-free, respirable cotton dust collected by a vertical elutriator or an equivalent method and averaged over an 8-hour period. Lead NIOSH considers “Lead” to mean metallic lead, lead oxides, and lead salts (including organic salts such as lead soaps but excluding lead arsenate). The NIOSH REL for lead (8-hour TWA) is 0.050 mg/m3 ; air concentrations should be maintained so that worker blood lead remains less than 0.060 mg Pb/100 g of whole blood. OSHA considers “Lead” to mean metallic lead, all inorganic lead compounds (lead oxides and lead salts), and a class of organic compounds called soaps; all other lead compounds are excluded from this definition. The OSHA PEL (8-hour TWA) is 0.050 mg/m3 ; other OSHA requirements can be found in 29 CFR 1910.1025. The OSHA PEL (8 hour-TWA) for lead in “non-ferrous foundries with less than 20 employees” is 0.075 mg/m3 . Mineral Dusts The OSHA PELS for “mineral dusts” listed below are from Table Z-3 of 29 CFR 1910.1000. The OSHA PEL (8-hour TWA) for crystalline silica (as respirable quartz) is either 250 mppcf divided by the value “%SiO2 + 5” or 10 mg/m3 divided by the value 348 A P P E N D I X C Appendix C (Continued) SUPPLEMENTARY EXPOSURE LIMITS “%SiO2 + 2.” The OSHA PEL (8-hour TWA) for crystalline silica (as total quartz) is 30 mg/m3 divided by the value “%SiO2 + 2.” The OSHA PELs (8-hour TWAs) for cristobalite and tridymite are ½ the values calculated above using the count or mass formulae for quartz. The OSHA PEL (8-hour TWA) for amorphous silica (including diatomaceous earth) is either 80 mg/m3 divided by the value “%SiO2,” or 20 mppcf. The OSHA PELs (8-hour TWAs) for talc (not containing asbestos), mica, and soapstone are 20 mppcf. The OSHA PEL (8-hour TWA) for portland cement is 50 mppcf. The OSHA PEL (8-hour TWA) for graphite (natural) is 15 mppcf. The PELs for talc (not containing asbestos), mica, soapstone, and portland cement are applicable if the material contains less than 1% crystalline silica. The OSHA PEL (8-hour TWA) for coal dust (as the respirable fraction) containing less than 5% SiO2 is 2.4 mg/m3 divided by the value “%SiO2 + 2.” The OSHA PEL (8-hour TWA) for coal dust (as the respirable fraction) containing greater than or equal to 5% SiO2 is 10 mg/m3 divided by the value “%SiO2 + 2.” NIAX® Catalyst ESN In May 1978, OSHA and NIOSH jointly published Current Intelligence Bulletin (CIB) 26: NIAX® Catalyst ESN. In this CIB, OSHA and NIOSH recommended that occupational exposure to NIAX® Catalyst ESN, its components, dimethylaminopropionitrile and bis(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)ether, as well as formulations containing either component, be minimized. Exposures should be limited to as few workers as possible, while minimizing workplace exposure concentrations with effective work practices and engineering controls. Exposed workers should be carefully monitored for potential disorders of the nervous and genitourinary system. Although substitution is a possible control measure, alternatives to NIAX® Catalyst ESN or its components should be carefully evaluated with regard to possible adverse health effects. Trichloroethylene NIOSH considers trichloroethylene (TCE) to be a potential occupational carcinogen and recommends a REL of 2 ppm (as a 60-minute ceiling) during the use of TCE as an anesthetic agent, and 25 ppm (as a 10-hour TWA) during all other exposures. Tungsten Carbide (Cemented) “Cemented tungsten carbide” or “hard metal” refers to a mixture of tungsten carbide, cobalt, and sometimes metal oxides or carbides and other metals (including nickel). When the cobalt (Co) content exceeds 2%, its contribution to the potential hazard is judged to exceed that of tungsten carbide. Therefore, the NIOSH REL (10-hour TWA) for cemented tungsten carbide containing >2% Co is 0.05 mg Co/m3 ; the applicable OSHA PEL is 0.1 mg Co/m3 (8-hour TWA). Nickel (Ni) may sometimes be used as a binder rather than cobalt. NIOSH considers cemented tungsten carbide containing nickel to be a potential occupational carcinogen and recommends a REL of 0.015 mg Ni/m3 (10-hour TWA). The OSHA PEL for Insoluble Nickel (i.e., a 1 mg Ni/m3 8-hour TWA) applies to mixtures of tungsten carbide and nickel. 349 A P P E N D I X D Appendix D SUBSTANCES WITH NO ESTABLISHED RELs After reviewing available published literature, NIOSH provided comments to OSHA on August 1, 1988, regarding the “Proposed Rule on Air Contaminants” (29 CFR 1910, Docket No. H-020). In these comments, NIOSH questioned whether the PELs proposed (and listed below) for the following substances included in the Pocket Guide were adequate to protect workers from recognized health hazards. The current PEL for each of these compounds is listed on the chemical page for each substance in the Pocket Guide. See pages xi-xii for a discussion of the vacated PELs. • Acetylene tetrabromide [TWA 1 ppm] • Chlorobenzene [TWA 75 ppm] • Ethyl bromide [TWA 200 ppm, STEL 250 ppm] • Ethylene glycol [C 50 ppm] • Ethyl ether [TWA 400 ppm, STEL 500 ppm] • Fenthion [TWA 0.2 mg/m3 (skin)] • Furfural [TWA 2 ppm (skin)] • 2-Isopropoxyethanol [TWA 25 ppm] • Isopropyl acetate [TWA 250 ppm, STEL 310 ppm] • Isopropylamine [TWA 5 ppm, STEL 10 ppm] • Manganese tetroxide (as Mn) [TWA 1 mg/m3 ] • Molybdenum (soluble compounds as Mo) [TWA 5 mg/m3 ] • Nitromethane [TWA 100 ppm] • m-Toluidine [TWA 2 ppm (skin)] • Triethylamine [TWA 10 ppm, STEL 15 ppm] At that time, NIOSH also conducted a limited evaluation of the literature and concluded that the documentation cited by OSHA was inadequate to support the proposed PEL (as an 8-hour TWA) of 10 mg/m3 for the compounds listed below. The current PEL for magnesium oxide fume is 15 mg/m3 (8-hour TWA, total particulate), and the current PEL for molybdenum (insoluble compounds as Mo) is 15 mg/m3 (8-hour TWA, total dust). For the other compounds listed below the current PEL is 15 mg/m3 (8-hour TWA, total dust) and 5 mg/m3 (8-hour TWA, respirable dust). • α-Alumina • Benomyl • Emery • Glycerine (mist) • Graphite (synthetic) • Magnesium oxide fume • Molybdenum (insoluble compounds as Mo) • Particulates not otherwise regulated • Picloram • Rouge 350 A P P E N D I X E Appendix E OSHA Respirator Requirements for Selected Chemicals Revisions to the OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard (29 CFR 1910.134) became effective on April 8, 1998. Incorporated within the preamble of this ruling were changes to OSHA regulations for several chemicals or substances, which are listed as subheadings in blue text throughout this appendix. These subheadings, which are also the titles of the affected standards within 29 CFR 1910 and 29 CFR 1926, are followed by the standard number(s) in parentheses and the OSHA respirator requirements.

Definitions for Type C and Type CE Respirators The definitions below were obtained from the NIOSH Certified Equipment List, which is available on the NIOSH Web site (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/cel). Type C Respirator: An airline respirator, for entry into and escape from atmospheres not immediately dangerous to life or health, which consists of a source of respirable breathing air, a hose, a detachable coupling, a control valve, orifice, a demand valve or pressure demand valve, and arrangement for attaching the hose to the wearer and a facepiece, hood, or helmet. Type CE Respirator: A Type C supplied-air respirator equipped with additional devices designed to protect the wearer's head and neck against impact and abrasion from rebounding abrasive material, and with shielding material such as plastic, glass, woven wire, sheet metal, or other suitable material to protect the window(s) of facepieces, hoods, and helmets which do not unduly interfere with the wearer's vision and permit easy access to the external surface of such window(s) for cleaning. A P P E N D X I F Appendix F MISCELLANEOUS NOTES Benzene The final OSHA Benzene standard in 1910.1028 applies to all occupational exposures to benzene except some subsegments of industry where exposures are consistently under the action level (i.e., distribution and sales of fuels, sealed containers and pipelines, coke production, oil and gas drilling and production, natural gas processing, and the percentage exclusion for liquid mixtures); for the excepted subsegments, the benzene limits in Table Z-2 apply (i.e., an 8-hour TWA of 10 ppm, an acceptable ceiling of 25 ppm, and 50 ppm for a maximum duration of 10 minutes as an acceptable maximum peak above the acceptable ceiling). Octachloronaphthalene Pentachloronaphthalene Tetrachloronaphthalene Trichloronaphthalene IDLH values for these four chloronaphthalene compounds are unknown. The Documentation for Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (NTIS Publication Number PB-94-195047) identified “Effective” IDLH values, based on analogy with other chloronaphthalenes and the then-effective NIOSH Respirator Decision Logic (DHHS [NIOSH] Publication No. 87-108; http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/87-108). These values for respirator recommendations were determined by multiplying the NIOSH REL or OSHA PEL by an assigned protection factor of 10. This assigned protection factor was used during the Standards Completion Program for deciding when the “most protective” respirators should be used for these four chemicals. Listed below are the “Effective” IDLH values that were determined using 10 times the REL or PEL for each chemical. For more information please consult the IDLH Documentation on the NIOSH Web site (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/idlh-1.html).
